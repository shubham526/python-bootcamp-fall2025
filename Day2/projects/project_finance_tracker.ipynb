    "2.  The `__init__()` method should accept `type` (a string like 'income' or 'expense'), `category` (a string like 'Salary' or 'Groceries'), and `amount` (a number).\n",
    "3.  Store these three pieces of information as attributes.\n",
    "4.  Add a method called `to_dict()` that returns the transaction's data as a **dictionary**. This will be very useful when we save the data to a JSON file."

    "    * If the file exists, it should open it, use `json.load()` to get the list of transactions, and return it.\n",
    "    * If the file doesn't exist, it should return an empty list `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`save_transactions(filepath, transactions)` function:**\n",
