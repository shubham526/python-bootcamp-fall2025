## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
No installation required! Click the "Open in Colab" buttons below to run notebooks directly in your browser.

### Option 2: Local Installation

If you prefer to run notebooks locally, we recommend using **Conda** as it handles Python installation and package management seamlessly.

#### Recommended: Using Conda (Easiest for Beginners)

**What is Conda?**
Conda is an all-in-one package and environment manager that comes with Anaconda or Miniconda. It includes Python and makes installing data science packages much simpler.

**Anaconda vs Miniconda:**
- **Anaconda:** Full distribution (~3GB) with 250+ pre-installed packages. Good if you have disk space and want everything ready.
- **Miniconda:** Minimal installer (~400MB) with just Python and conda. You install only what you need. **We recommend this.**

**Step 1: Install Miniconda**
1. Download Miniconda from [docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. **Important:** Check "Add Miniconda to PATH" during installation (or restart your terminal after installation)

**Step 2: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-bootcamp-umsl.git
cd python-bootcamp-umsl
```

**Step 3: Create Conda Environment**
```bash
# Create environment named 'bootcamp' with Python 3.10 and all required packages
conda create -n bootcamp python=3.10 pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter requests -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate bootcamp
```

After activation, you'll see `(bootcamp)` at the start of your command prompt.

**Step 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This opens Jupyter in your browser. Navigate to the notebook you want to work with.

**Step 5: When You're Done**
```bash
# Deactivate the environment
conda deactivate
```

**For Future Sessions:**
```bash
# Just activate and launch
conda activate bootcamp
jupyter notebook
```

---

#### Alternative: Using pip and venv (If You Already Have Python)

If you already have Python 3.8+ installed, you can use virtual environments with pip.

**What is a Virtual Environment?**
A virtual environment is an isolated Python workspace that keeps project dependencies separate. It prevents package conflicts between different projects.

**Setup Steps:**

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-bootcamp-umsl.git
cd python-bootcamp-umsl

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter requests

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# When done
deactivate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-bootcamp-umsl.git
cd python-bootcamp-umsl

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter requests

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# When done
deactivate
```

---

#### Troubleshooting

**"conda: command not found"**
- Restart your terminal after installing Miniconda
- Or manually add Conda to PATH: Run the Miniconda installer again and ensure "Add to PATH" is checked

**"python3: command not found" (for venv method)**
- You need to install Python first from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Or switch to the Conda method above

**Jupyter won't start**
```bash
# Make sure your environment is activated first
conda activate bootcamp  # or: source venv/bin/activate

# Then try launching again
jupyter notebook
```

**Can't see notebooks in Jupyter**
- Make sure you're in the `python-bootcamp-umsl` directory when you run `jupyter notebook`
- Navigate using Jupyter's file browser

**Windows Execution Policy Error (venv method)**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

#### Quick Command Reference

**Conda:**
```bash
conda activate bootcamp      # Start working
jupyter notebook            # Launch Jupyter
conda deactivate            # Stop working

conda env list              # See all environments
conda list                  # See installed packages
```

**Venv:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate    # Start (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate       # Start (Windows)
jupyter notebook            # Launch Jupyter
deactivate                  # Stop
```
